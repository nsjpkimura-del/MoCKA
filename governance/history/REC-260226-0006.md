# Context


# Options
﻿- Principle:
  - No outfield write without explicit human approval.
- Mechanism:
  - Approval is represented by a local file flag:
    governance/propagation/APPROVED_TO_SYNC.flag
- Rules:
  - Flag must exist and contain exact text: APPROVED
  - Flag is single-use by default: sync deletes it after a successful write (optional strict mode)
  - If flag is missing or invalid, sync must exit with non-zero status
- Scope:
  - Applies to all propagation targets (Sheets, Firebase, others)
- Audit:
  - Every sync run emits a local log line stating: approved=true/false, target, count

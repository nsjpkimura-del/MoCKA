## Title
Phase24 Infield Institutionalization Charter

## Purpose
Define the governance structure and operational rules for Infield as the canonical memory layer of MoCKA civilization.

## Scope
Applies to:
- seeds
- docs
- calc
- index control
- archive lifecycle

## Principles
1. CSV is index only.
2. Markdown/Word/PDF is canonical body.
3. Python/JSON is reproducible source.
4. Sheets is 75 percent external view only.
5. Importance A only may propagate outward.

## Operational Rule
All new records must:
- create body first
- register index second
- verify link_target exists
- preserve UTF-8 encoding
- use LF newline

## Lifecycle
draft -> active -> superseded -> archived

## Declaration
Phase24-A officially begins institutional Infield governance.

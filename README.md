MoCKA
Deterministic Cryptographic Audit Chain

MoCKA is an experimental cryptographic audit framework built around one question:

Can strong, reproducible integrity guarantees be achieved without blockchain or distributed consensus?

Core Features

Deterministic SHA256 append-only chain
Per-entry Ed25519 signatures
Enforced key retirement (valid_to model)
Multi-observer separation (logical + physical)
RFC3161 external timestamp anchoring
Public reproducible proof package

What This Is

A minimal, strict integrity experiment.
A governance-focused audit-chain model.
A reproducible cryptographic structure.

What This Is Not

Not a blockchain.
Not a token system.
Not a distributed consensus protocol.
Not a product.

Independent cryptographic review is welcome.
